Monte_Carlo_Files_1 uses limiting mags of 30 for each filter, and a sigma that is proportional to 10**age.

Monte_Carlo_Files_2 uses limiting mags of 28 for each filter, and a sigma that is proportional to 10000000, rather than 10**age.

Monte_Carlo_Files_3 uses limiting mags of 30 for each filter, and a sigma that is proportional to 10000000, rather than 10**age.

Monte_Carlo_Files_4 no longer uses limiting mags, instead requiring a signal-to-noise of 3, and a positive flux in each band. Sigma is proportional to 10000000, rather than 10**age.

Monte_Carlo_Files_5 requires a signal-to-noise of 3, and a positive flux in each band. Sigma is proportional to 10**age.

Monte_Carlo_Files_6 requires a signal-to-noise of 3, but calculates CChi as a difference in flux space, rather than magnitude space. Thus, it also doesnâ€™t require a positive flux in each band. Sigma is proportional to 10**age

Monte_Carlo_Files_7 is the same as 6, but for SN 2010ae.

Monte_Carlo_Files_8 is also for SN 2010ae, but fit in magnitude space, requiring a signal to noise of 3, positive flux in each band, and has sigma proportional to 10**age.

Monte_Carlo_Files_9 is the same as 8, but with the flux error estimation fixed.
